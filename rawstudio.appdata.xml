    <p>
      Rawstudio is an open-source program to read and manipulate RAW
      images from digital cameras.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get the best quality out of your digital camera, it is often
      recommended that you record your pictures in RAW format. This format
      is mostly specific to a camera and cannot be read by most image
      editing applications. Our goal is to supply you with a tool, where
      you can have the benefits of RAW images and the ease of use of JPEG
      images.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main focus of Rawstudio is to enable efficient review and fast
      processing of large image collections. We aim to supply you with a
      tool that makes it possible for you to review and process several
      hundred images in a matter of a few hours.
